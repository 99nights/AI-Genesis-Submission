# ShopNexus - Pitch Deck
## AI Operating System for Autonomous Retail

---

## Slide 1: The Problem

**Independent 24/7 shops waste 20-40 hours/week on manual inventory management.**

Operators spend countless hours counting shelves, tracking expiration dates, and reconciling stock levels. A typical 150m² shop loses €40-80K/year to waste and inefficiency. Existing solutions are built for large chains—too expensive and complex for independent operators.

---

## Slide 2: The Solution

**ShopNexus: The AI operating system that makes 24/7 shops truly autonomous.**

We eliminate manual inventory work through real-time OCR scanning, intelligent waste prevention, and peer-to-peer marketplace connectivity. ShopNexus cuts management time by 85% and reduces waste by 35-60%, turning independent shops into profitable, hands-off operations.

---

## Slide 3: How It Works - Core Technology

**Multi-modal AI powered by Google Gemini processes images in real-time.**

Our system uses `gemini-2.5-flash` for fast OCR and product identification, plus `gemini-2.5-pro` for advanced inventory analysis. Camera-based scanning automatically extracts product data, expiration dates, and stock levels without manual entry. Qdrant vector database enables semantic search and RAG-powered natural language queries.

---

## Slide 4: How It Works - Vector Intelligence

**Qdrant vector database powers intelligent product matching and insights.**

Our architecture uses 10+ specialized collections for products, inventory, batches, and marketplace listings. Semantic search enables operators to ask questions like "Show me products expiring this week within 5km" and get instant, accurate answers. Visual feature learning improves scan accuracy over time.

---

## Slide 5: User Experience

**[Screen Recording: Live Demo of ShopNexus in Action]**

Watch as an operator scans a shelf with their phone—products are instantly identified, stock levels updated, and expiration alerts generated. The interface shows real-time inventory, waste predictions, and marketplace opportunities. Natural language queries provide instant business insights without complex dashboards.

---

## Slide 6: Market Opportunity - TAM

**Total Addressable Market: $957B global convenience channel, growing to $1.4T by 2033.**

The autonomous/unmanned retail segment represents $82.56B in 2025, growing at 24.7% CAGR to $600B+ by 2034. Retail automation market is $27-30B today, heading to $64-74B by 2032. Food waste alone costs retailers billions annually—even 5% waste reduction represents tens of billions in saved margin.

---

## Slide 7: Market Opportunity - SAM

**Serviceable Addressable Market: 400,000+ independent 24/7 shops in Europe and Asia.**

Our target: small-format autonomous stores (Spätis, kiosks, unmanned convenience) that need affordable, integrated solutions. Europe and Asia will add tens of thousands of these units in the next 5 years. At €299/month average subscription, SAM represents €1.2B+ annual recurring revenue potential.

---

## Slide 8: Revenue Streams

**Three revenue streams: SaaS subscriptions, marketplace fees, and hardware partnerships.**

Tiered SaaS: €199-€499/month per store based on size and features. Marketplace transaction fees: 4-6% on peer-to-peer stock trades (high margin). Optional premium hardware partnerships with revenue share. Average shop generates €4K/month in savings—pays for itself in 6 weeks.

---

## Slide 9: Competitive Landscape

**Enterprise players serve chains; mid-market lacks AI; hardware-only solutions are expensive.**

Blue Yonder, Oracle, SAP target million-euro chain contracts. Lightspeed, Vend offer basic POS without computer vision or waste prevention. AiFi, Grabango sell expensive camera systems to large operators. No one offers full vertical integration for autonomous SMB retail at an affordable price point.

---

## Slide 10: Our Unique Selling Proposition

**We're the only platform combining real-time OCR, RAG intelligence, and peer-to-peer marketplace at SMB price point.**

Full vertical integration: inventory, POS, waste prevention, and network marketplace in one subscription. AI-powered insights accessible through natural language—no complex training required. Network effects create local supply meshes that reduce waste by 40-60% additional. We own the "autonomous SMB retail OS + local supply mesh" position.

---

## Slide 11: Unit Economics & ROI

**Customers see <2 month payback with average savings of €4K/month per shop.**

Waste reduction saves €3-5K/month. Time savings (30 hours/week) worth €3K+/month. Network revenue upside adds €1-3K extra margin/month. Total value: €7-11K/month savings vs. €299/month cost. Clear path to profitability for both customers and ShopNexus.

---

## Slide 12: Go-to-Market Strategy

**Phase 1 (2026): Launch in DACH region with 50-100 pilot stores already in negotiation.**

Germany, Austria, Switzerland have highest density of 24/7 Spätis and strongest autonomous store roll-out. Phase 2 expands to Poland, Sweden, Benelux, Japan, and South Korea. Target: 1,000 shops in 18 months, reaching €5M ARR and proving network flywheel effects.

---

## Slide 13: Future Prospects - Scalability

**Network effects create exponential value as more shops join the platform.**

Each new shop increases marketplace liquidity and reduces waste across the network. At 15-20 shops per city, marketplace activates—waste drops another 40-60%. Scalable architecture handles thousands of shops with Qdrant vector database and cloud infrastructure. Platform becomes more valuable with each participant.

---

## Slide 14: Future Prospects - Impact

**Vision: 50,000+ shops across Europe and Asia by 2030, moving billions in network volume.**

ShopNexus becomes the de-facto operating layer for independent 24/7 convenience segment. Waste approaches zero through predictive systems and network optimization. Profitability never seen before in the segment. We're building the "Linux of autonomous retail"—open for hardware partners, closed enough to own the network.

---

## Slide 15: The Opportunity

**AI, computer vision, and network effects converge in an $80B+ high-growth segment that's completely underserved.**

This is the rare intersection where technology meets real-world business value. Independent shop owners desperately need solutions built for them, not adapted from enterprise systems. ShopNexus delivers measurable ROI from day one while building network effects that create sustainable competitive moats.
